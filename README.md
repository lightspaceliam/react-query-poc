# React Query POC

My 1st exploration into how React Query handles state management. Initial thoughts:

- A lot less boiler plate code
- Wonder how it would scale
- I'm not initializing in a `useEffect`. Do I need to?
- Seems to easy. What am I missing?
- Very easy to transform JSON payloads to a TypeScript interface even if it's done outside React Query.

**TODO:**

- How to abstract out 
- Unit testing
